Building a React Native To-Do app with user authentication 
is a comprehensive project that involves multiple steps. 
Below, I'll outline a high-level plan to help you get started:

Step 1: Project Setup

Set up your development environment for React Native. 
Follow the official React Native documentation for installation instructions.
Step 2: Create the Project Structure

Create a clean and organized project structure. You can use tools 
like Expo CLI or React Native CLI to initialize a new project.
Organize your project files into folders such as components, 
screens, navigation, redux (if you choose to use Redux), and utils.
Step 3: Implement User Authentication

Choose a user authentication method:
Firebase Authentication: Firebase provides a 
ready-to-use authentication system. 
Follow Firebase documentation to set up Firebase in your project 
and implement email/password authentication.
Custom Authentication: If you want to implement 
your own authentication system, you can use libraries 
like bcrypt for password hashing and store user data in a database.
Step 4: Create Authentication Screens

Build screens for user registration and login.
Use React Native's built-in components for input fields, buttons, and forms.
Implement error handling for authentication (e.g., invalid email, password requirements).
Step 5: Implement State Management

Decide whether to use React's built-in state or a state management library like Redux. 
Redux is recommended for larger, more complex apps.
Define actions, reducers, 
and store for managing tasks and user authentication state.
Step 6: Task Management

Create screens for displaying the list of tasks and adding new tasks.
Implement functionality to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
Implement task data storage. 
You can use AsyncStorage for a simple local storage solution or 
set up a backend API (Node.js with MongoDB, for example) 
for more advanced data management.
Step 7: Enhance Features (Optional)

Add task due dates.
Implement task categories or tags.
Implement sorting or filtering tasks.
Design a visually appealing user interface. 
You can use libraries like react-native-paper or styled-components for styling.
Implement any additional features you believe would enhance 
the app's functionality or user experience.
Step 8: Testing and Debugging

Test your app on Android and iOS devices/emulators.
Use debugging tools like React Native Debugger or 
Expo DevTools to identify and fix issues.
Step 9: Documentation and Comments

Document your code, especially for complex logic or custom components.
Include comments to explain important sections, functions, and components.
Step 10: Deployment

Prepare your app for deployment by configuring the necessary build settings.
Follow React Native's deployment documentation to generate APKs for Android and IPA files for iOS.
Step 11: Submission

Review your project to ensure it meets the assignment requirements.
Share the codebase and any relevant documentation with your instructor or employer 
as per their submission guidelines.
Remember that this is a comprehensive project, and it may take 
some time to complete, especially if you are new to React Native or mobile app development. 
Take it step by step, and don't hesitate to consult the official 
React Native documentation and relevant libraries' documentation as needed. 
Good luck with your assignment!
