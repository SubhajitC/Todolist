Explanation of the folder structure and key files:

android/ and ios/: These folders 
contain the platform-specific files and configurations 
for Android and iOS. You won't need to modify them often.

node_modules/: This folder contains all the dependencies 
installed for your project. You don't need to manage it manually.

src/: This is where most of your application code resides.

components/: This folder contains reusable components. 
You have separate folders for authentication-related components and task-related components.

Auth/: Components related to user authentication.

Login.js: The login screen.
Register.js: The registration screen.
Other related components.
Tasks/: Components for managing tasks.

TaskList.js: Component for displaying the list of tasks.
TaskItem.js: Component for rendering individual tasks.
AddTaskForm.js: Component for adding new tasks.
Other related components.
navigation/: This folder contains navigation-related files.

AppNavigator.js: The main navigation component, where you define your app's navigation stack.
redux/: This folder contains Redux-related files for state management.

actions.js: Actions for modifying the state.
reducers.js: Reducers to manage the state.
store.js: Redux store setup.
screens/: Screens for different parts of your app.

HomeScreen.js: The main screen for managing tasks.
LoginScreen.js: The login screen.
RegisterScreen.js: The registration screen.
Other screens related to your app.
App.js: The main entry point of your React Native app, where you set up navigation.

firebase.js: The configuration file for Firebase. 
This is where you initialize and configure Firebase for authentication and data storage.

package.json: The project's package.json file that lists your project's dependencies and scripts.

This folder structure is just a starting point and 
can be adjusted based on your project's specific requirements and preferences. 
It's essential to keep your code organized and 
modular to make it easier to maintain and scale your React Native app.
