To find your MongoDB connection string using MongoDB Compass, follow these steps:

Open MongoDB Compass: Launch MongoDB Compass on your Windows 11 PC.

Connect to MongoDB: Click on "Connect to Host" or "Connect" 
to initiate a connection to your MongoDB server.

Connect to Your MongoDB Server: You may need to specify connection details. Typically, 
you'll connect to a remote server or a local server. Here's how to do both:

Connect to a Remote MongoDB Server:

Choose "Connect to a Host."
Enter the MongoDB server address and port provided by your hosting service or system administrator.
If your MongoDB server requires authentication, enter your username and password.
Click "Connect."
Connect to a Local MongoDB Server (localhost):

Choose "Connect to a localhost."
The connection details for a local MongoDB server should typically be pre-filled as 
"localhost" and the default port "27017."
If your local MongoDB server requires authentication, enter your username and password.
Click "Connect."
View Connection Details: After successfully connecting to the MongoDB server, 
you'll see a list of databases on the left side of the MongoDB Compass interface.

Retrieve Connection String:

Click on the database you want to use for your application.
In the database view, look for the "Connect" button or similar. 
It's often located near the top right corner.
Click on "Connect."
MongoDB Compass will provide you with a connection string that you can copy. 
This connection string contains all the information 
needed to connect to your MongoDB database, including the hostname, port, 
authentication credentials, and database name.
Copy Connection String: Click the "Copy" 
button next to the connection string to copy it to your clipboard.

Now, you can use this copied connection string as the value 
for MONGODB_URI in your .env file for your Node.js backend project.

Remember to replace "your_mongodb_connection_string" in the .env 
file with the actual connection string you copied from MongoDB Compass. 
This connection string allows your Node.js backend to connect to your MongoDB database.
