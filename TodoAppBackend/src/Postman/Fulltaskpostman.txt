Your taskController.js and taskRoutes.js code looks correct. 
You have defined the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 
operations for tasks in your taskController.js, and in your taskRoutes.js, 
you've created a route for the createTask function. 
You can add more routes as needed for other operations.

Now, to test your routes in Postman:

Ensure that your server is running with the node app command.

Open Postman.

Select the HTTP method you want to test (e.g., POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

Enter the appropriate URL for your task-related route. For example:

To create a task: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
To get all tasks: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks
in postman =>http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/64fdd411a6a99dc206cba9fe
To get a specific task by ID: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/{taskId}
in postman =>http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/64fdd411a6a99dc206cba9fe
To update a task by ID: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/{taskId}
To delete a task by ID: http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/{taskId}
in postman =>http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/64fdd411a6a99dc206cba9fe
Replace {taskId} with the actual ID of the task when testing the routes that require it.

If you are sending data in the request body (e.g., for creating or updating tasks), 
click on the "Body" tab in Postman and select "raw." Then, 
enter the JSON data as required by your route. For example:
For PUT
http://localhost:5000/api/tasks/64fdd411a6a99dc206cba9fe
json
Copy code
{
  "title": "Updated Task Title",
  "description": "Updated Task Description",
  "completed": true
}
Click the "Send" button to make the request.

You should receive responses based on the operations you are performing 
(e.g., created task, list of tasks, updated task, or deletion confirmation).

Repeat these steps for each of your task-related routes to thoroughly test your API.
