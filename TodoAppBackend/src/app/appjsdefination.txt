Your app.js code looks good for setting up your Node.js 
server and connecting it to your MongoDB database. 
It also defines the routes for tasks and users using the Express.js framework.

Here's a breakdown of what your code does:

Imports: You import the required dependencies such as Express, 
the connectDB function to connect to MongoDB, and the route handlers for tasks and users.

Express App Setup: You create an instance of the Express application by calling express(). 
This instance, stored in the app variable, will be used to define routes and configure middleware.

Middleware Configuration: You configure the body-parser middleware to parse JSON requests. 
This middleware is essential for handling JSON data sent in HTTP requests.

Database Connection: You call the connectDB() function to establish a 
connection to your MongoDB database. This ensures that your server can interact with the database.

Route Definitions: You define routes for tasks and users using app.use(). 
These routes will be handled by the respective route handlers (taskRoutes and userRoutes) 
that you've imported.

Server Startup: You specify a port number for your server, and it listens on that port. 
If process.env.PORT is not defined (e.g., in a production environment), 
it defaults to port 5000. The server starts listening for incoming HTTP requests, 
and you log a message indicating the server is running.

This code is a solid foundation for building your Node.js backend API. 
You can now proceed to implement the route handlers and controllers for tasks and users, 
define the necessary MongoDB models, 
and create the API endpoints to interact with your database.

Make sure to handle any errors, add authentication and authorization if required, 
and implement the desired functionality for your To-Do app's backend.
