To run your Node.js backend server, you can follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the root directory of your backend project. 
In your case, it's the TodoAppBackend directory 
where your package.json and app.js files are located.

Run the following command to start your Node.js server:

bash
Copy code
node src/app.js
This command tells Node.js to execute the app.js file, 
which contains your Express application setup and server configuration.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message in the 
terminal indicating that your server is running. 
The message will include the port number, such as:

arduino
Copy code
Server is running on port 5000
